After finishing my PhD, I was able to stay at the Department of Mechanical Engineering where I did my research as a permanent member of the technical support staff. As a mechanical design expert, I guide researchers in the design of their experimental setups, and translate their and other industrial partners' needs into a prototype which can be manufactured in house. We have many production techniques available providing a lot of freedom in designing using novel methods. 

As a former PhD student in the department, I am in the ideal position to help the researchers pursueing a PhD themselves, as I went through the process they are currently on. I know research can be very demanding. By providing support in mechanical design, they can focus on their research instead of botching something together quickly.
