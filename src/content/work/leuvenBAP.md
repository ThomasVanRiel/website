Thesis: _Feasibility of a hybrid wire electrodischarge-electrochemical machining platform_

This thesis investigates the hybridization of wire electrical discharge machining (wire EDM) and wire electrochemical machining (wire ECM) to enhance precision and surface integrity. By combining wire EDM's accuracy and shaping efficiency with ECM's non-damaging material removal, the research addresses surface damage issues inherent in traditional wire EDM. 
This work includes a comprehensive analysis of wire EDM and ECM principles, modeling of wire ECM parameters, and an exploration of a hybrid electrolyte medium. Results show excellent geometric accuracy and surface quality, with applications in aerospace and mould and die manufacturing.
