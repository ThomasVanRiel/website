import ProjectionVisualizer from './ProjectionVisualizer.astro';

<ProjectionVisualizer />

## TO DO
Unwrap the sphere using various methods. Webgl? Threejs?

https://proj.org/en/stable/operations/projections/spilhaus.html
https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html
https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-06/nb/03-coordinate-reference-system.html
Pixel art style maps!

## Ideas

Rasterize maps to dots (lat/lon). Colors?
Position the dots based on projections (hardcoded projected positions on canvas?)
Interpolate the dots based on slider between maps
Globe projection looking at null island -> Visibility also required (alpha?)

Creating multiple data files for interpolation (large dots, smaller, ludicrous details)

### UI
Sphere centered on Belgium. (rotating?)
WHen user clicks a button with a projection method the dots transform to the requested projection. A box with information on the projection is shown below.
