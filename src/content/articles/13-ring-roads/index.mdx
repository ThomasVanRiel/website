## Introduction
Which Belgian ring road is the best ring? To answer this question, we first need to define what a ring road is:

<Definition 
    term="ring road"
    partOfSpeech="noun"
    pronunciation="/rĭng roʊd/"
    definitions={[
        { number: 1, text: "A circumferential highway around a town, city, or other conurbation." },
        { number: 2, text: "A highway that encircles an urban area so that traffic does not have to pass through the center.", example: "The Brussels Ring Road handles over 20 vehicles daily." }
    ]}
/>

In our case, let's call **all**, and **only**, roads which are referered to with an **R-number** a ring road. 
This excludes several national roads, such as the <RoadLabel label="N" number="712"/> around Pelt, which shows promising ring-like characteristics. 
If a road is not deemed impressive or important enough to warant an R-number, it is certainly not impressive enough to be called the _ringiest_ Belgian ring road.  
Some ring roads were planned but ultimately failed to come to fruition. A noteable example is the <RoadLabel label="R" number="7"/> around Liège, 
which was planned to be formed by the unfinished <RoadLabel label="A" number="604"/>, the <RoadLabel label="E" number="42"/>, the <RoadLabel label="E" number="25"/>, and the planned but cancelled <RoadLabel label="A" number="605"/>.

The name "ring road" implies two properties of such roads: they are _ringlike_, and they are roads.  
The latter property is trivially satisfied by our definition above, so let's focus on the former:

<Definition
    term="ring" 
    partOfSpeech="noun" 
    pronunciation="/rĭng/"
    definitions={[
        { number: 1, text: "A circular object, form, line, or arrangement. " },
        { number: 2, text: "A small circular band, generally made of precious metal and often set with jewels, worn on the finger." },
        { number: 3, text: "A circular band used for carrying, holding, or containing something. ", example: "a ***** ring." }
    ]}
/>

Let's define a ring as **circular**, and **closed**. 
The latter of these properties is a tad more flexible than the former, as an open ring is quite common, 
both in road infrastructure and in other _ringlike_ objects (earrings, keychains).
The best ring road is hence the one that is the most circular while being reasonably closed.

As the problem is now clearly defined, we can focus on finding the solution. 
The next section will explain the method that was selected to evaluate the circularity.

## Method


### Data acquisition
Road data is acquired from OpenStreetMap using the Overpass API.

**TODO**: Add image showing the wayfeatures on the map, with ring roads highlighted.

### Rasterization
Because the road data is in vector format, it needs to be rasterized to avoid bias towards roads with more data points.
The roads are rasterized to a 800x800 pixel image, with pixel size chosen such that the entire road fits within the image.

<ImageThemed

    alt="Rasterized road R23 in Belgium."
/>

### Circle fitting
A circle is fitted to the rasterized road data using MSAC, a variant of RANSAC.

**TODO**: Explain MSAC briefly.




## Results and conclusion

TODO

import Roads from "Roads.astro"

<Roads/>
