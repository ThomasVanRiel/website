Unless explicitly stated, AI is not used, was never used, nor will it ever be used to generate main content for this website. It is used as a tool to facilitate implementations in code using github copilot in VS Code. The extent of AI used is specified in the header of relevant scripts. The main project code is fully user written (with documentation and examples in hand) to maintain a good overview of the project.
