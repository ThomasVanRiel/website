Unless explicitly stated, AI is not used, was never used, nor will it ever be used to generate main content for this website. The content of this website is hence guaranteed to be free of (AI-)slop.

Github copilot is used as a tool to facilitate programming in VS Code using a variety of models (incl. GPT-5 mini and Claude Sonnet 4.5). 
The main project structure is fully user written (with documentation and examples in hand) to maintain a good overview of the project. 
If LLM tools were used to generate scripts, it is mentioned in the header of the script, including the extent of its use.
