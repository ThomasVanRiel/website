Iterating on designs is not always easy
- One of the most dangerous ... in mechanical design is the sunken cost fallacy
- Fail fast, fail often, fail cheap
- Failing is *never* a problem, failing is essential.
- Iterative process
- Earlier iterations are not thrown away because you learned a lot in them.

## The (general) process of mechanical design

## When do you start with CAD?
CAD is a communication tool to share the design with partners, not a tool to help design.
Many people think CAD stands for Computer Aided Design, but it actually stands for Communication After Design.

- Digital twin: No cad, simple blocks
- Embodiment design: No CAD, simple sketches
- You are *(almost)* certain your design will work and only need to decide exact dimensions. You can CAD
