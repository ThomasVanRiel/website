## State of the art
Recipes are almost always presented in steps with a lot of explanation.
I tend to lose track of the process due to the detached steps, which do not seem to follow the order of operations.
Having multiple parallel tasks is inherent in cooking, but is not straightforward to present in text.
It is hence required that the cook prepare themselves by reading the full recipe before starting ... **but I will never comply**.
Following recipes is hence a frustrating experience, as it tends to become a chaotic exercise in time management. (Let's ignore the often ridiculous ingredient lists with wrong units ... for now.)

## What is an appropriate solution?
**Flowcharts!** They can present material, or ingredient flow graphically, making it quite straightforward to keep an overview of the current state of the process and ingredients.
Let's forego any further introduction and jump straight into examples from the Belgian cuisine.
