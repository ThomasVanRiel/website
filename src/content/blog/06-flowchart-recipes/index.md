## Cooking is art, baking is science
is a saying known to many who occupy kitchens, which is often interpreted as to require precise measurements of ingredients and to apply a strict order of very specific operations.

This is not how science works ... Although replication is an important part of _science_, it is by far the most important part. 

Even if replication would be the most important step of _science_, where are the tolerances on the values? My 130 grams readout on the kitchen scale is not the same as yours due to inaccuracies in measurement, which gets even worse when converting US recipes (how would I even measure the volume of a solid block of butter to obtain 1 cup?!)
Not every oven is the same, the heating curves are different, the heat spots are different, even the moisture content in the oven is different ... The quality of flour is never the same, if it is even specified what flour was originally used ... What if the chicken who graciously donated her egg had a bad mood ...

It all contributes to my horrible experience with baking recipes, the pictures and the descriptions of the baked goods promise heavenly desserts, leading to a gigantic letdown (if they even survive the intense uncontrolleable hellfires of our ancient propane oven).

### Whenever I find a recipe online, I read this:

Ingredients:
 - Random length of sugar,
 - π/3 eggs (small? Large? Should I keep the scale?),
 - Some random volume of solid butter (am I supposed to calculate the volume myself and convert it to the size of some american cup?),
 - Water (Is any water, ok or should I collect it from the source in the Himalayas?),

Recipe:
 - Combine flour and sugar in a large bowl.
 - Combine with the milk and egg mixture you prepared earlier within 17 seconds or it will explode. (Wait, what mix?)
 - Put in the oven preheated at 815.67 °R. (Oh, I should have preheated?)
 - Remove from oven after exactly 22 minutes, NOT A SECOND LATER!
