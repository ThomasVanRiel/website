## Introduction
Which Belgian ring road is the best ring?

### Definitions

<Definition 
    term="ring road"
    partOfSpeech="noun"
    pronunciation="/rĭng roʊd/"
    definitions={[
        { number: 1, text: "A circumferential highway around a town, city, or other conurbation." },
        { number: 2, text: "A highway that encircles an urban area so that traffic does not have to pass through the center.", example: "The Brussels Ring Road handles over 20 vehicles daily." }

In our case, let's call all, and only, roads which are referered to with an R-number a ring road. This excludes several national roads, such as the <RoadLabel label="N" number="712"/> around Pelt, which shows promising ring-like characteristics.  
If a road is not deemed impressive enough to warant an R-number, it is certainly not impressive enough to be classified as a _true_ ring road.  
Some roads were planned to become a ring road but ultimately failed to become a ring. A noteable example is the <RoadLabel label="R" number="7"/> around Liège was planned to be formed by <RoadLabel label="A" number="604"/> and <RoadLabel label="A" number="605"/>

        { number: 1, text: "A circular object, form, line, or arrangement. " },
        { number: 2, text: "A small circular band, generally made of precious metal and often set with jewels, worn on the finger." },
        { number: 3, text: "A circular band used for carrying, holding, or containing something. ", example: "a ***** ring." }

Let's define a ring as **circular**, and **closed**. The latter of these properties is a tad more flexible than the former, as an open ring is quite common, both in road infrastructure and in other _ringlike_ objects (earrings, keychains). The best ring road is hence the one that is the most circular while being reasonably closed.
