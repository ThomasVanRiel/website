Building on the idea that [recipes should be flowcharts](/blog/06-flowchart-recipes), this post explores how to convert traditional text-based recipes into clear, visual flowcharts.
Using D3.js, a node network is generated from a recipe. The process steps and ingredients are dragable for flexibility and clarity.
Fill in your recipe in the text box (see example syntax below) and click <kbd>Generate Flowchart</kbd>.

The generator is still work in progress as e.g. quantities of ingredients are not yet included. As always, constructive feedback is appreciated.
