import RecipeFlowchart from "./RecipeFlowchart.astro";

Building on the idea that [recipes should be flowcharts](/blog/06-flowchart-recipes), this post explores how to convert traditional text-based recipes into clear, visual flowcharts.
Using D3.js, a node network is generated from a recipe. The process steps and ingredients are dragable for flexibility and clarity.

Fill in your recipe in the text box and click <kbd>Generate Flowchart</kbd>. 
Two example recipes are added below to showcase the recipe syntax and a possible final image *(lightmode only)* after (re)organizing the flowchart. 
Feel free to copy the recipes in the recipe text box to see what happens.

After generating the initial recipe flowchart. You can drag around the nodes to obtain a logical order and to avoid overlaps of links between nodes. This process requires some artistic input from the user (for now ...).
*The flowchart adapts to light/dark mode, but was designed for light mode first.* 

<RecipeFlowchart />

## Recipe syntax[^1]

These examples are based on the recipes from [the previous post on the topic](/blog/06-flowchart-recipes). 

*The generated images are not optimized for dark mode as the exporter (currently) only supports light mode exporting for printing purposes.*
